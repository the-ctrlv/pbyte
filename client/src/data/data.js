Prior to breaking ground on development of the Postage Health web interface, Postage Health first worked closely with the consultant to develop a unique and memorable brand identity.  The identity prioritizes passive (yet unambiguous) communication of the company culture, mission, and personality - a proven strategy especially well suited to startups which primarily in the digital space. Their logo is a stylized letter “P” tastefully employing the natural geometries of organic chemistry for an esoteric clue towards the hormonal nature of their work. The color palette is a near monochromatic variety of Sages and Greens, envoking an heir of transparent competence grounded in respect for mother nature.',

    text: 'One in Four men over 30 suffer from low testosterone. The vast majority of these deficient men are unaware of their condition, and thus sacrifice health and quality of life while remaining untreated. Postage Health intends to change this, by offering affordable diagnostic tests, and personalized comprehensive treatment plans under the care of clinical specialists. Postage Health started with a vision of bringing the entirety of the care directly to the patient via Telemedicine.  The only physical participation required of the patient would be opening their mailbox, as all laboratory sample-collection kits, treatment supplies and even the medications are delivered via mail.  But as Postage Health set out to implement their vision, they quickly discovered harsh realities of a woefully outdated and underserved world of healthcare technologies.  They searched exhaustively for EHRs and adjacent service providers which could support the Postage Health model, but satisfied the requirements. Postage Health would have to develop their own solutions.  Enter Panoptic Byte.',

      'Onboarding: Tell the app about your fitness goals, conditioning, and preferences',
    text: 'Starting a fitness journey with Tr(ai)nStation toward achieving personal goals first necessarily requires a bit of setup, which primarily consists of the App collecting information, stats, and survey responses from the User. While best to avoid such processes during the first impression, in this case there was no way around it.  The A.I. requires this basic information in order to start providing useful workout routines.  So for Tr(ai)nStation, the goal was making the onboarding process as quick and painless as possible. \n Within these constraints, we focused ourselves on reducing friction in any and every way we could.  Questions were broken up and simplified in a clean format to avoid a cluttered look or an "wall of text."  Input fields were thoughtfully chosen and tested to be as intuitive to use as possible across mobile, tablet and desktop devices alike.  By breaking the onboarding process into bite-sized steps, there was no bad taste left in the User’s mouth.',
