    "description": "Wow, that looks great but does it work? Most people can tell a good strategy, design, or brand when they see one, but many products that check those boxes are poorly developed. Getting a website or app built is the most expensive and foreign part to most people, and rightly so because there is no easy way to tell until after the product is already built if it works the way it is supposed to. Choosing the right team behind your product development is the most intuitive portion of the development lifecycle. In most cases, data is king, but when deciding who will develop your website or app, listen to your gut. Whether it is us or someone else, make sure it feels right."

    "description": "The idea is usually the easiest part. What follows is what is hard. Taking the concept, devising the correct strategy, and executing that strategy is what separates ideas from products. There is no one size fits all approach, and we treat every new project as a blank canvas to create a one-of-one masterpiece."

    "description": "A product’s brand and design are something that must be carefully crafted. Many brands look like the last, and the users can see right through them. When I look at the best brands, I feel the authenticity and transparency of what they stand for. In most cases, people will choose the brand they identify with, even when times are tough for the product. Tell and show the user what they are getting when they choose you and live up to those expectations."

    "description": "Information is only as useful as it is accessible.  Which is to say - having fantastic documentation is worth nothing if it can't be easily located in the moment that it's needed.  Where Search tooling never quite lived up to our needs, Large Language Models have recently leapt forward in a revolutionary way.  Imagine if ChatGPT knew your specific documentation, product, knowledge base, or policies & procedures, and could provide real time answers to the most pressing and specific questions of your team members and customers.  You're in luck - this is exactly the sort of custom AI solution that Panoptic Byte is proud to now offer to our clients."

    "description": "Don’t sweat about the look and feel of the product because nailing the functionality that the customer wants is what is most important. Unfortunately, those days are long gone. How the user feels and interacts with a product is critical in casting your first impression. You want to illustrate to the user that how you do anything is how you do everything while providing a seamless user experience."
